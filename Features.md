## Features (Aka Mod-Specific Changes)

### Actually Additions
* Vertical digger now digs across y=0, and digs down to a max depth below it - up to M blocks below
  the digger itself, or y=N, whichever is shallower (higher in the world).

### Ranged Pumps
* Ender pump now pumps across y=0, and pumps down to a max depth below it - up to M blocks below
  the pump itself, or y=N, whichever is shallower (higher in the world).

### Worley's Caves
* In cubic world types, uses a modified implementation of Worley's Caves that works below y=0.
